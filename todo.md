#ToDo List

- implement "dummy" offline and online heuristic (closest taxi, for example...)

- Make a better randomized heuristic
  - "Gradient descent"

- Use LightGraphs instead of Graphs to optimize performance
  - Change "solutions" to go from location to location and not road to road

- Clean the project a little
